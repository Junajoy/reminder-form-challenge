# Reminder Form Component

This React component is a simple reminder creation form with conditional notification preferences.

## What You Need to Do

1. **Add State Management:**
   - Track values for the reminder text, date, email, and WhatsApp number.
   - Track which notification types are selected using checkboxes.

2. **Conditional Rendering:**
   - Only show the email or WhatsApp input fields if the respective checkboxes are selected.

3. **Form Submission:**
   - Capture form data and simulate storing it or sending it somewhere (console log is fine for now).

4. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Add validation.
   - Add local storage support.
   - Add form reset after submit.

## Skills Practiced

- React controlled components
- Conditional rendering
- Event handling in forms
- Clean, readable styling with plain CSS

Happy coding!
